## üìú Description

The **GitHub Unfollow Script** is a powerful Python tool designed to help you manage your GitHub following list effectively. This script automatically unfollows users who are not following you back, ensuring your network remains relevant and streamlined.

Perfect for maintaining a streamlined and relevant network on GitHub! This script is for developers and GitHub users who want to keep their following list clean and relevant, automating the tedious task of unfollowing inactive or non-reciprocal followers.

### How It Works

- **GitHub API Integration:** The script interacts with GitHub using the official GitHub API.
- **Authentication via Personal Access Token:** Securely authenticate using a personal access token, which you provide in a `.env` file.
- **Automated Unfollowing:** The script fetches your list of followers and the users you are following, identifies those who do not follow you back, and automatically unfollows them.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates a detailed report of the operation, including the current followers, current following, and a list of users who were unfollowed. The report is saved in the `logs` directory with a timestamp, and the result is also printed in the console.
